dotfiles
========

My dotfiles.

Previous versions of this setup were trying to be ... too automatic, but now I appreciate nebulosity.

Symlink most of these files from inside `$HOME`.

`.zshrc` won't work properly without an Oh My Zsh installation, not included. `fiddlemath.zsh-themes` is my (simple) Oh My Zsh custom theme.

Symlink the contents of `.config`, but not the directory itself.

Similarly, symlink the contents of `.emacs.d`, but not the directory itself. `.emacs` can be symlinked directly.
